Government can use this system to build up the knowledge base by nicely selecting reliable documents, and during the interaction of people with disabilities with the system, the reference would always be provided to the user.

Connecting Communities: Your Guide to local Information and Services
How can we assist local residents and visitors in easily locating local services?
Current search function in the website is not useful enough, people always want to find specific service instead of an article. We build up the knowledge base from the website of local government. When user enquire a service name, response would be the url to it.

How can we provide answers to frequently asked questions about local services?
Our AI-powered assistant can quickly retrieve and present answers to common questions from the local services knowledge base.

How can we create a solution that is inclusive and accommodates diverse populations, including those with language barriers, disabilities, or limited access to technology?
Our platform incorporates multiple accessibility features, language options, and voice interaction to cater to diverse needs.

How can we leverage location awareness to offer personalized service recommendations?
We will have different knowledge bases for different locations. The user can choose the location by default detection or selecting.

How can we develop a user-friendly solution that is scalable across local communities?
Our modular knowledge base approach allows for easy scaling and customization for different communities while maintaining a consistent user interface.

Civic participation for a more resilient, cohesive democracy

Our platform offers interactive discussion threads on civic topics, allowing users to engage with educational content in a participatory manner.

How can we help build people's trust in government services?
We build trust through transparent sourcing of information and providing easy access to accurate government information.

How can we increase people's understanding of government and democratic processes to increase civic participation?
We have discussion threads built up for established topics around government selected knowledge base. In these threads users can ask questions and check the answers.

How can we increase people's use of civic infrastructure (both physical spaces and digital spaces)? We have the knowledge base that has the urls to the online services.

How can we support people to become more active in community discussions, deliberation, and community decisions?
We have the discussion threads built up for established topics around government selected knowledge base.

How can we create opportunities for community connection and improve people's sense of belonging?
By providing a platform for shared learning and discussion on local and national issues, we create virtual spaces for community connection and belonging.
